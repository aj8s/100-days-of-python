# Description

Welcome to the 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, the only course you need to learn to code with Python. 
100 days, 1 hour per day, learn to build 1 project per day, this is how you master Python. Even if you have zero programming experience, this course will take you from beginner to professional. Here's why:

- The course has been updated to be 2023 ready and you'll be learning the latest tools and technologies used at large companies such as Apple, Google and Netflix.
- This course doesn't cut any corners, there are beautiful animated explanation videos and tens of real-world projects which you will get to build. e.g. Tinder auto swiper, Snake game, Blog Website, LinkedIn Auto Submit Job Application
- The curriculum was developed over a period of 2 years, with comprehensive student testing and feedback.
- We've taught over 600,000 students how to code and many have gone on to change their lives by becoming professional developers or starting their own tech startup.
- You'll save yourself over $12,000 by enrolling, and still get access to the same teaching materials and learn from the same instructor and curriculum as our in-person programming Bootcamp.
- The course is constantly updated with new content, with new projects and modules determined by students - that's you!

We'll take you step-by-step through engaging video tutorials and teach you everything you need to know to succeed as a Python developer. The course includes over 65 hours of HD video tutorials and builds your programming knowledge while making real-world Python projects.
Throughout this comprehensive course, we cover a massive amount of tools and technologies, including:

- Learn about the basic structure of a Python program: comments, indentation, and white space.

## Day 2: 
- Learn about variables in Python: what they are, how to declare them, and how to assign values to them.
- Practice using variables to store and manipulate different types of data (e.g., strings, integers, floats).
- Learn about the different data types in Python: int, float, str, bool, and None.

## Day 3:

- Practice using operators to perform calculations and make decisions in your programs.

## Day 4:
- Learn about the if statement in Python: how to use it to make decisions in your programs.
- Practice using the if statement to control the flow of your programs.

## Day 5:
- Learn about the for loop in Python: how to use it to iterate over lists and other iterable objects.
- Practice using the for loop to perform tasks on each element of a list.

## Day 6:
- Learn about the while loop in Python: how to use it to repeat a block of code until a specific condition is met.
- Practice using the while loop to perform tasks until a certain condition is reached.

## Day 7:

- Practice using functions to organize and reuse code in your programs.

## Day 8:
- Learn about modules in Python: how to import and use them in your programs.

## Day 9:
- Learn about lists in Python: how to create, modify, and access list elements.
- Practice using lists to store and manipulate data in your programs.

## Day 10:
- Learn about tuples in Python: how they differ from lists, and how to create, modify, and access tuple elements.
- Practice using tuples to store and manipulate data in your programs.
- Learn about the tuple function: how to use it to convert other data types to tuples.
